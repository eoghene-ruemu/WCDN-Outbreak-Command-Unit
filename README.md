🟣 WCDN — Outbreak Command Unit
SOC/SIEM | Threat Detection | Triage Operations | Cloud Security

🛡️ Project Overview

The Outbreak Command Unit is a fully simulated SOC/SIEM environment within the Wakanda Cyber Defense Network (WCDN).
This project demonstrates real-world SOC operations, including:

🛰️ Alert ingestion

🧭 Outbreak triage

📊 Severity classification

⚡ Escalation workflows

🕵🏾 Threat hunting coordination

📚 Evidence collection

☁️ AWS cloud security monitoring

🔐 MITRE ATT&CK alignment

As the Outbreak Triage Specialist, I processed, validated, and escalated cloud-based security alerts generated during multi-stage cyber outbreak simulations.

This repo showcases my readiness for SOC Analyst, Cloud Security Analyst, and Incident Response roles.

🧭 Outbreak Workflow (Triage Pipeline)
⚠ Alert Detected → Triage Intake → Severity Assigned
→ Ticket Creation → Evidence Attached → Escalation to Threat Hunters
→ Command Ops Brief → Containment / Remediation Actions

🔍 Role: Outbreak Triage Specialist

My primary responsibilities in this simulation included:

Reviewing every incoming alert for credibility

Classifying each into the correct severity tier

Mapping events to MITRE ATT&CK

Creating actionable tickets

Routing to Threat Hunting, IR, or Command Ops

Communicating outbreak status in real time

Ensuring all evidence was captured and logged

🔬 Sample Tickets Handled
Urgent Severity

• Unauthorized IAM privilege escalation attempt
• EC2 credential theft signature
• Malicious IP communication (C2 behavior)

High Severity

• Brute force authentication attempts
• Reconnaissance scan from unknown IP
• Large spike in outbound network traffic

Medium Severity

• Root login detected without MFA
• Unusual API activity
• Disabled CloudTrail attempt

Low Severity

• Benign recon activity
• Non-impactful port probes
• Routine log noise

🧰 Lessons Learned

Triage efficiency determines the success of the entire SOC

MITRE mapping improves investigative accuracy

GuardDuty + CloudTrail = powerful signal combination

Severity classification must be consistent to avoid mis-escalation

Communication is the backbone of coordinated response

Evidence completeness reduces bottlenecks for Threat Hunters

🚀 Next Steps

Integrate automated triage scripts

Add enrichment from VirusTotal or AbuseIPDB

Expand playbooks for lateral movement detection

Add dashboards for outbreak visualization
