### Severity Classification Framework

To ensure consistency across the Outbreak Command Unit, all alerts were classified using the internal WCDN severity matrix:

**Urgent:**  
Active threat, credential compromise, privilege escalation, or events impacting production security.

**High:**  
Malicious activity with potential for impact, such as brute force attempts, suspicious API calls, or reconnaissance behavior.

**Medium:**  
Configuration issues, blocked workflow actions, access-denied errors affecting SOC visibility or tooling.

**Low:**  
Benign events, testing artifacts, or informational findings requiring no immediate action.

Each alert was triaged immediately, and severity determined the escalation path to Threat Hunters or Command Ops.
